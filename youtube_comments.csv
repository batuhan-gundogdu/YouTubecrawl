2025-05-18T19:20:59Z,Valley police departments launch &#39;Click It or Ticket&#39; campaign to enforce seat belt use,"Seat belt laws for front-seat passengers are grounded in decades of data showing that belts significantly reduce fatalities and injuries in crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports seat belts reduce the risk of fatal injury by about 45-60% for front-seat occupants. Most U.S. states mandate seat belts for front-seat passengers (and often all passengers) because vehicles are designed with restraint systems for those seats, and the laws reflect that infrastructure.
Now, riding in the bed of a pickup truck is a different story. There’s no built-in restraint system in a truck bed—no seat belts, no airbags, nothing. You’re essentially cargo back there, exposed to ejection, impact, or road debris. The NHTSA notes that passengers in truck beds face a much higher risk of injury or death in a crash, with ejection being a leading cause. Despite this, regulations on truck bed passengers are surprisingly lax in many places. As of my last data, about 20 U.S. states still allow passengers in truck beds without restrictions, often due to historical or cultural practices (e.g., rural areas, farm work). Other states limit it by age, speed, or distance, but enforcement is spotty"

2025-05-18T19:20:59Z,Valley police departments launch &#39;Click It or Ticket&#39; campaign to enforce seat belt use,"@@tjmayer9103 know the law before you run your mouth. 

“In Phoenix and across Arizona, police cannot pull over a vehicle solely for a seatbelt violation. Arizona is a secondary enforcement state for seatbelts, meaning a police officer must have reasonable cause to believe another traffic violation has occurred before they can stop a car for not wearing a seatbelt.”"

“Not every item of news should be published. Rather must those who control news policies endeavor to make every item of new serve a certain purpose.”
“Propaganda works best when those who are being manipulated are confident, they are acting on their own free will.”  
“The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly - it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over.”
“The secret of propaganda: Those who are to be persuaded by it should be completely immersed in the ideas of the propaganda, without ever noticing that they are be immersed in it.”
“Propaganda must facilitate the displacement of aggression by specifying the targets for hatred.”"

2025-05-16T14:26:13Z,"Greer Fire grows to more than 11,000 acres",A fire ban was in place but that doesn’t stop some people. It was probably either that or a careless smoker.
2025-05-16T14:26:13Z,"Greer Fire grows to more than 11,000 acres",I think it was a transformer that blew during high winds that caused this. And the high winds just took over pushing the fire
2025-05-16T14:26:13Z,"Greer Fire grows to more than 11,000 acres",Initial reports states it was an electrical transformer that may have been damaged by high winds. Not fully confirmed as utility workers didnt find evidence.  It started in private property and not in a campsite.  We'll see when this is over if any of this is true.
